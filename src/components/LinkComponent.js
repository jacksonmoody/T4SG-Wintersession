                    <p>
                        Blocking groups can “link” with another blocking group, which means that you will be placed in the same “House Neighborhood,” within a two-minute walk. They will not be in the same house. 
                        <br /> <br />
                        This usually occurs with groups that are too large to include in one block.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
