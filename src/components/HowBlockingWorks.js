                Blocking is a process in which first-years form 
                self-selected groups of one to eight people who will 
                then be placed into the same house on Housing Day in the spring.
                <br /> <br />
                It is not necessary that you become roommates with your blockmates your sophomore year, 
                but you do have the option to do so. 
                <br /> <br />
                This platform is here to facilitate your blocking experience!
